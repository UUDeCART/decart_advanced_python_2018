# Advanced (Continuing) Python Programming
## Applications with Linear Algebra

This course will continue on from the DeCART Python boot camp, by developing Python programming skills with an emphasis on problem decomposition, debugging, and profiling skills. This course will also move away from Jupyter notebooks and focus on using integrated development environments (IDEs) for writing Python scripts, modules, and packages. Programming problems will primarily be drawn from numeric linear algebra.

## Programming Skills (no promises!)

* Use of Spyder as an IDE for debugging
* Use of Python profiling code to identify code refactoring opportunities
* Use of Cython or solutions for improved performance
* pyTest
* PyLint
* [vprof](https://github.com/nvdv/vprof)

## Linear Algebra Topics

* Vector representation
* Vector algebra
* Matrices
* Matrix multiplication
* Eigenvalues
* Matrix Inversion and SVD

## Prerequisities

Students should have prior Python programming experience (such as the boot camp or equivalent).

Students will need their own laptop with Anaconda installed.
