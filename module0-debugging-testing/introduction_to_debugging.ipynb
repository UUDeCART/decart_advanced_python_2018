In this module, we will be learning some tips and tricks to help us find and fix errors in our programs. Going back to the early days of programming, these errors are referred to as \"bugs\" and finding and fixing them is usually referred to as \"debugging.\" \n",

We can use systematic search heuristics to find the errors. Heuristics is a key word here, and we will make frequent references to Polya's method in this module."

However, if we type that code into an editor that has integration with PyLint (e.g. I have PyLint integrated into my vim editors), we see an error highlighted with a squiggly, red underline. If I click on that underlining, the editor (via PyLint) tells me \"Undefined name 'rang'\".\n",
